# BST-in-python
A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree where each node has a key and values that satisfy the following properties:

1. The key of any node in the left subtree is less than the key of the node.
2. The key of any node in the right subtree is greater than the key of the node.
3. There are no duplicate keys in the tree (each key is unique).
 

Example of **BST**.
